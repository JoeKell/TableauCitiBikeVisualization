## Summary

***** Need to edit

In this project I am building dashboards and other visualizations using Tableau to relay information about the Citi Bike data from New York City.

### Using the Final Application
The application can be reached at <https://joekell.github.io/D3InteractiveScatterPlot/> and is hosted on Github Pages. When opening the dashboard, the x-axis of the scatter plot represents the average age of people in the state and the y-axis represents the percent of people that smoke:

You are then able to scroll down to see detailed notes on using the chart.

## Tools
These are the tools, techniques, and resources used in this project.

* Tableau is used for creating dashboards and other auxillary visuals

* Jupyter Notebook is used to combine the data into one file

### About the Data

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

My visualizations use data from June 2020 through January 2021, during which time the United States was being brutalized by COVID-19.
